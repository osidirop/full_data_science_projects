# The initial dataset *Mountains.csv* from wikipedia contains the World's highest mountains. The are two jupyter notebooks:
* In **Mountains_cleaning_data.ipynb** some cleaning on the initial dataset is performed (for e.g. removing unnecessary columns, NaN rows, etc) and creates a file called *Mountains_cleaned.csv* to be analyzed afterwards
* In **Mountains_analysis.ipynb** the appropriate analysis is performed in order to answer the following questions:
  * Which are the most difficult mountains to climb?
  * What were the most popular years for climbing?
  * Are taller mountains more difficult to climb?
  * Are mountains over 8000m more popular for climbing?
  * Which mountain ranges contain the highest mountains?
